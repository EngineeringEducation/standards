This is the Skills repo for Enki. 

Skills are based off of Standards, which are an approach to describing what constitudes performance of a skill, and performance _levels_ of a skill.

Skills at Enki are the superstructure uniting all of the open-source curriculum materials. They are intended to serve a broader purpose- defining a set of skills developers can learn and acrue experience points in. This is intended to be an open-source instructional design resource, as well as an open data model for building experience point systems on top of. The loftiest goal of this repository is to create an agreed-upon skills map, so that educators and students alike can keep up with the exact skill needs of employers. 

This repo is in Beta. We're still shaking out the data model.

The top-level folders are Topics.  
The README in the Topic folder lists all of the Standards for a Course.  
The files in the second level of folders are Standards, they are grouped by Course.
Each file has a Standard, a Description, a unique identifier, and Objectives. This should allow you to bucket points at the Topic, Subtopic, Standard, and Objective level. You can implement the depth of tracking that you need, you don't have to use every piece of the data model. 

Right now, the best examples of complete courses, with standards, and objectives for those standards, are:
- SQL 
- JavaScript
- Data
- Python
- Linux
- Computer Science

Currently working on refactoring:
  


Needs objectives, deeper descriptions:
- Web
- Java


Next Steps for the data model:
- define prerequisite standards
- define _suggested_ prerequisite standards
- add generalized rubrics for objectives
