# Analyze the performance of your machine

slug: unix.analyze-system-performance

## Description
This standard covers using tools to analyze system performance, in order to determine slowdowns, anomalies, and investigate other performance-affecting mechanisms.

---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Use `ps` to monitor the resource usage of processes
- Use `iostat` to monitor the performance of storage devices
- Use `memstat` to monitor the resource usage of processes
- Determine the source of anomalous memory usage with `ps`
- Determine the source of anomalous cpu usage `ps`
- Determine the source of anomalous device usage with `iostat`
