# Communicate securely across a wide area network

slug: unix.communicate-securely-WAN

## Description
This standard deals with the ability to secure communications across a wide area network.

---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

0. Distinguish secure from insecure network protocols
1. Monitor the suitability of cryptographic algorithms for encrypting communications against being intercepted and unencrypted
2. Generate and store cryptographic keys for cryptographic handshake protocols
3. Monitor the suitability of cryptographic algorithms for encrypting communications to sign or verify their authenticity
4. Monitor the suitability of certificate issuing authorities for verification of identity
5. Sign communications using a certificate from a certificate issuing authority to verify the authenticity of the source of the communications (SSL)
