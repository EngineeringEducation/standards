# Direct program input and output using stdin, stdout, pipes and redirection

slug: unix.standard-streams-pipelines

## Description
This standard covers file input and output descriptors, the standard streams, `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`, and their manipulation through pipelines.

---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

0. Distinguish the purpose and output of the standard streams
1. Redirect `stdout` to a file
2. Use the `stdout` of one program as the `stdin` for another program with a pipe
3. Direct `stdout` and `stderr` to different places
4. Tail a `stderr` and `stdout` log in two terminal windows
5. Use pipes to direct data through multiple programs
