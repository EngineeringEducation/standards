# Analyze the complexity of common pathfinding algorithms

slug: cs.analyze-complexity-pathfinding-algorithms

## Description
This standard deals with describing complexity in terms of the Big-O notation in pathfinding algorithms.


## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Accurately describe the complexity of Djkistra's
- Accurately describe the complexity of A*
- Accurately describe the complexity of Breadth-First-Search
- Accurately describe the complexity of Depth-First-Search in an arboreal graph
