# Implement and use linear collection data structures

slug: cs.implement-linear-collection-data-structures

## Description
This standard deals with accurately choosing a linear collection to solve a problem, and using that structure appropriately. It also deals with the implementation of these data structures and their attendant methods for data access and manipulation.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Implement a Linked List and use it to solve a problem
- Implement a Stack and use it to solve a problem
- Implement a Queue and use it to solve a problem
- Implement a Indexable Ordered Sets (arrays, skip lists, etc) to solve a problem
