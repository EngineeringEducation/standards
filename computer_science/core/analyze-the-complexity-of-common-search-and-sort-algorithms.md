# Analyze the complexity of common search and sort algorithms

slug: cs.analyze-complexity-search-sort-algorithms

## Description
This standard deals with describing complexity in terms of the Big-O notation in searching algorithms that do common types of searches on linear data structures. This is not about the performance of indexing documents for search optimization, or search engines, or advanced probabilistic searches. This is only about estimating complexity, not knowledge of the algorithms themselves.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Analyze and accurately predict the complexity of linear searches
- Analyze and accurately predict the complexity of other searching algorithms
- Analyze and accurately predict the complexity of sorting algorithms
