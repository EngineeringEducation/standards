## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Analyze a JavaScript project's dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Analyze a Python project's dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Analyze a Java project's dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Analyze a Ruby project's dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Mitigate security vulnerabilities by upgrading vulnerable packages uncovered with an analysis tool
