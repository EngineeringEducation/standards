## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Distinguish between open network protocols and their secure counterparts
- Distinguish secure traffic from insecure traffic using a packet sniffing tool, eg wireshark
- Distinguish TCP and UDP handshake protocols from TLS handshake protocols
