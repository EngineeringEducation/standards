# Analyze the complexity of common data structure access operations

slug: cs.analyze-complexity-data-structure-access-operations

## Description
This standard deals with describing complexity in terms of the Big-O notation in common data structure access operations. For example, hash table value lookups, or appending a value to  the end of an array.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

0. Accurately describe the complexity of Array access, search, insertion, and deletion
1. Accurately describe the complexity of Stack access, search, insertion, and deletion
2. Accurately describe the complexity of Queue access, search, insertion, and deletion
3. Accurately describe the complexity of Doubly and Singly Linked List access, search, insertion, and deletion, and contrast the differences
4. Accurately describe the complexity of Hash Table access, search, insertion, and deletion
5. Accurately describe the complexity of Skip List access, search, insertion, and deletion
6. Accurately describe the complexity of Binary Search Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
7. Accurately describe the complexity of Cartesian Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
8. Accurately describe the complexity of B-Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
9. Accurately describe the complexity of Red-Black Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
10. Accurately describe the complexity of Splay Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
11. Accurately describe the complexity of AVL Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
12. Accurately describe the complexity of KD Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
