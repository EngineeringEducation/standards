# Implement and use graph data structures

slug: cs.implement-graph-data-structures

## Description
This standard deals with the implementation of a graph data structure, containing nodes and edges. Graphs used to show these objectives can be of various types, but each graph type must be covered (for example, if you only show trees, you can't determine if a graph is cyclic.)

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

0. Implement a Tree
1. Use a tree appropriately to solve a problem
2. Implement a binary tree
3. Use a binary tree appropriately to solve a problem
4. Implement a red-black tree
5. Use a red-black tree appropriately to solve a problem
6. Implement a graph data structure
7. Write an algorithm to identify if a graph is cyclic
8. Write an algorithm to identify if a graph is complete
9. Implement and Use a directed graph appropriately to solve a problem
10. Implement and Use an undirected graph appropriately to solve a problem
11. Implement and Use a weighted graph appropriately to solve a problem
