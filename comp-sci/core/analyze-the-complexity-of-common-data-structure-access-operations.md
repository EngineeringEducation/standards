# Analyze the complexity of common data structure access operations

slug: cs.analyze-complexity-data-structure-access-operations

## Description
This standard deals with describing complexity in terms of the Big-O notation in common data structure access operations. For example, hash table value lookups, or appending a value to  the end of an array.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Accurately describe the complexity of Array access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Accurately describe the complexity of Stack access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Here
- Accurately describe the complexity of Queue access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Accurately describe the complexity of Doubly and Singly Linked List access, search, insertion, and deletion, and contrast the differences
- Accurately describe the complexity of Hash Table access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Accurately describe the complexity of Skip List access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Accurately describe the complexity of Binary Search Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Accurately describe the complexity of Cartesian Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Accurately describe the complexity of B-Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Accurately describe the complexity of Red-Black Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Accurately describe the complexity of Splay Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Accurately describe the complexity of AVL Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Accurately describe the complexity of KD Tree access, search, insertion, and deletion
