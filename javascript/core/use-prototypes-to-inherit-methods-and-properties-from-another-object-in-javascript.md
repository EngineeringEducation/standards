# Use prototypes to create class-like objects in JavaScript

slug: js.prototype-inherit

## Description
This standard covers using the prototype of a constructor function to create a class-like object, and inheriting methods and properties from another object higher in the prototype chain, from which instances can be produced that share common methods and properties, but not common property values.

---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Set the prototype of the constructor function to inherit methods on instances produced by the constructor function
- Modify the instance using an inherited prototype's method
