# Use prototypes to create class-like objects in JavaScript

slug: js.prototype-class

## Description
This standard covers using the prototype of a constructor function to create a class-like object, from which instances can be produced that share common methods and properties, but not common property values.

---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Use a constructor function and the execution context of that function to produce an instance with particular properties
- Use the prototype of the constructor function to set methods on instances produced by the constructor function
- Modify the instance using a prototype method
