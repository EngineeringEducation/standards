# Use control flow structures to control the flow of a program in JavaScript

slug: js.control-flow

## Description

This standard deals with any use of a control flow structure used to control the flow of a program in order to execute the correct statements in the correct logical sequence in JavaScript.

Creating and calling functions is contained within this standard only in the sense that it must be demonstrated that one can use a function to logically order statements or conditionally execute them. The functions can be created by any method, be declared anywhere, and can be called in any fashion. Creating methods on an object and using them, or calling the map function with an arrow function that the user defines work equally well for this purpose.

try..catch blocks is contained within this standard only in the sense that it deals with control flow from an exceptions perspective.
