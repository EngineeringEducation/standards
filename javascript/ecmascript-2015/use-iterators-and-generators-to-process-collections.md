# Use iterators and generators to process collections

slug: js.iterators-generators

## Description
This standard deals with the iteration protocol in JavaScript as defined in ES6, and generators, and their use to process a collection or respond dynamically to evented input.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Use `for..of` loops to iterate over a collection by value
- Use generator functions to `yield` a sequence
- Use a generator to invert control
- Use a generator to manage asynchronous activity by suspending execution until after a promise has resolved
