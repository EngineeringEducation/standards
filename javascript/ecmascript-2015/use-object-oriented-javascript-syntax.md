slug: js.es6-class

## Description
This standard covers using the `class` and `extends` keywords, and `constructor` function with `super`.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Use the `class` keyword to declare a class, using the `constructor` function
- Use the `extends` keyword to inherit from another class, and use `super` in the constructor function
