## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Use the Promise constructor to create a new promise
- Use `.then` to await promise resolution
- Use `.catch` to catch errors
- Use `.all` to await multiple promises
- Use `.resolve` to resolve a promise
- Use `.reject` to reject a promise
- Use `.race` to race promises
