## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Use `pipe` to read from a streaming interface
- Use `write` to write to a stream
- Use `pause` and `resume` effectively to pause and resume streams
- Use stream events to robustly handle a stream's states
