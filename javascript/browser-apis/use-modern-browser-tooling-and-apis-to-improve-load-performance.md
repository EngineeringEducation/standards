# Use modern browser tooling and APIs to improve load performance

slug: js.browser-tooling

## Description
This standard deals with use of Chrome Dev Tools, Safari Web Inspector, Firefox Developer Console, or Internet Explorer Developer Tools. Not all toolchains support all activities, so some performances may require the use of a specific toolset.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

0. Use in-browser tooling to measure resource loading times to identify network bottlenecks
1. Use in-browser tooling to profile memory issues and identify memory leaks
2. Use in-browser tooling to analyze runtime performance and improve efficiency
