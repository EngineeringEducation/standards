# Summarize, represent, and interpret data on two quantitative variables

slug: data.represent-interpret-quantitative-variables

## Description
This standard covers the representation and interpretation of data on two quantitative variables.

---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatter plot, and describe how the variables are related.
- Fit a function to the data; use functions fitted to data to solve problems in the context of the data. Use given functions or choose a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear, quadratic, and exponential models.
- Informally assess the fit of a function by plotting and analyzing residuals.
- Fit a linear function for a scatter plot that suggests a linear association.
