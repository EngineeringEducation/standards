# Calculate covariance and correlation and use them to solve problems

slug: data.covariance-correlation

## Description
This standard covers the calculation of covariance and correlation and use them to solve problems.


---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

0. Develop a probability distribution for two random variables defined for a sample space in which theoretical probabilities can be calculated; find the covariance
1. Develop a probability distribution for two random variables defined for a sample space in which probabilities are assigned empirically; find the covariance
2. Describe correlation and its perils with respect to Anscombeâ€™s quartet
3. Distinguish correlation and causation
