# Calculate expected value and variance and use them to solve problems

slug: data.expected-value-variance

## Description
This standard covers the calculation of expected value and variance and use of them to solve problems.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Define a random variable for a quantity of interest by assigning a numerical value to each event in a sample space; graph the corresponding probability distribution using the same graphical displays as for data distributions.
- Calculate the expected value of a random variable; interpret it as the mean of the probability distribution.
- Calculate and interpret the variance of a random variable
- Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which theoretical probabilities can be calculated; find the expected value and variance
- Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which probabilities are assigned empirically; find the expected value and variance
