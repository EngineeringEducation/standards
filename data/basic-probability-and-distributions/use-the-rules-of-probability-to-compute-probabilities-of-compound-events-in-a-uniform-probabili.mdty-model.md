# Use the rules of probability to compute probabilities of compound events (in a uniform probability model)

slug: data.probability-compound-uniform

## Description
This standard covers the use of the rules of probability to compute probabilities of compound events in a uniform probability model.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Find the conditional probability of A given B as the fraction of B’s outcomes that also belong to A, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
- Apply the Addition Rule, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
- Apply the general Multiplication Rule in a uniform probability model, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
