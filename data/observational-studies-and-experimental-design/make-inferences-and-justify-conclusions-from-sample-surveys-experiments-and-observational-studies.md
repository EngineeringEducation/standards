## Description
This standard covers the ability to inferences and justify conclusions from sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.
- Use data from a sample survey to estimate a population mean or proportion; develop a margin of error.
- Use data from a randomized experiment to compare two treatments; decide if differences between parameters are significant.
- Distinguish correlation and causation
