# Write queries to read data from multiple related tables

slug: sql.read-multiple-tables

## Description
This standard specifically deals with the skill of `JOIN`ing multiple tables together to produce a set of data.
This means that the data model for this assessment needs to have at least one join table that relates two different tables together, and one that relates a table to itself. A good example model is relating Users to other Users (as in friendships), and Users to Items they've purchased through Orders (a join table).
