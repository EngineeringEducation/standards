# Write queries to aggregate data from multiple related tables

slug: sql.aggregate-multiple-tables

## Description
This standard deals specifically with the aggregation of data across multiple joined sets of data.

---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Aggregate data using the GROUP BY statement and the `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` to collate information across related tables
- Use `MAX` and `MIN` to look at the boundaries of a subset of data that is distributed across multiple tables
- Use columns from related tables to aggregate a compound value
