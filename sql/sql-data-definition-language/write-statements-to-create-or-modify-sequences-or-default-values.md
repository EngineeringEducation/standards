## Description
This standard has to do with columns with computed values, sequences, auto-incrementing values, GUIDs, defaults, etc. Any type of data-altering computation that is defined by the column.

- Write column definitions to create auto-incrementing IDs
- Write column definitions with default values that are static
- Write column definitions with default values that are computed
