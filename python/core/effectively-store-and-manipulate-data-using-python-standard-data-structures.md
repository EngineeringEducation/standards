# Effectively store and manipulate data using Python standard data structures

slug: py.store-manipulate-data

## Description
This standard deals with the ability to access and transform data effectively. It is intended to measure the use of python data structures.

---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Access deeply nested data structures
- Store data in deeply nested data structures
- Transform arbitrarily formatted data into another format
- Format data for transport across a network
- Encode data in a standard data carrying format (json, xml, csv, etc)
- Load data into a data structure to support an algorithm's efficient execution
