slug: py.store-manipulate-data

## Description
This standard deals with the ability to access and transform data effectively. It is intended to measure the use of python data structures.

---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

0. Access deeply nested data structures
1. Store data in deeply nested data structures
2. Transform arbitrarily formatted data into another format
3. Format data for transport across a network
4. Encode data in a standard data carrying format (json, xml, csv, etc)
5. Load data into a data structure to support an algorithm's efficient execution
