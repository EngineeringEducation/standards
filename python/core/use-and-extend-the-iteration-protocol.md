# Use and extend the iteration protocol

slug: py.use-iteration-protocol

## Description
This standard has to do with the use of iterators, the `iter` function, and the iterator protocol in Python.

---
## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Use for loops to iterate over an iterable
- Iterate over an iterable without a for loop
- Distinguish iterators from sequences
- Identify Python's native iterables
- Use the `iter` and `next` functions to create an iterable
