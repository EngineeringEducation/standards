# Use control structures to control the flow of a program in Python

slug: py.control-structures

## Description
This standard deals with use of a control flow structure used to control the flow of a program in order to execute the correct statements in the correct logical sequence in Python.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Make a decision about which control flow structure to use in order to execute statements in the correct logical sequence
- Demonstrate the use of:
  - if statements
  - for loops
  - while loops
  - creating and calling functions

  Creating and calling functions is contained within this standard only in the sense that it must be demonstrated that one can use a function to logically order statements or conditionally execute them. The functions can be created by any method, be declared anywhere, and can be called in any fashion. Creating methods on an object and using them, or calling the map function with an arrow function that the user defines work equally well for this purpose.
