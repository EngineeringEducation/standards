# Accurately describe a wide range of data structures and relevant uses

slug: py.data-structures-uses

## Description
This standard deals with the use of data structures in python. It intends to measure the proper choice of data structure, in terms of efficiency of access and suitability for the problem. It also intends to measure the accurate use of these data structures to solve problems, where accuracy is defined by using the most efficient and direct access operations and methods of the given data structure for the problem.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

- Use Python's Iterator types to solve a problem requiring representation of a linear sequence
- Use Python's Mapping types to solve a problem requiring representation of a non-sequenced set or O(1) data structure access
- Use Python's Set types to solve a problem requiring unique sets of data
- Use a binary structure to hold binary data
- Use the standard library's functions for heapq to solve a problem requiring a priority queue
- Use Python's string type to solve a problem requiring the reformatting of data
